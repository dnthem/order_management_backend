# Backend Logistics:

1. When a client makes a request to a specific route representing a store or collection, the API responds by returning all the associated data in an array format.
   [__data here__]

2. If the client includes both a store/collection and an ID in their request, the API retrieves and returns a single JSON object representing the document that matches the specified ID.

3. In any other case where the client's request does not fit into the above categories, the API responds with a JSON object containing only one property named "error".
   { "error": "error message here" }

# Backend Logistics for the Two Routes:

## Authentication Route:
  The authentication route manages user signup and login procedures.

  The API implements JWT for authentication. Upon signup/login, a token is generated and stored by the client. Subsequent requests include this token for authentication, ensuring secure backend access without relying on sessions or exposing sensitive data.

## Index Route:

The index route is responsible for handling all the stores/collections.

GET: /:store - Retrieves all the data from the specified store, returning it in an array format.

GET: /:store/:id - Retrieves a single document from the specified store based on the provided ID, returning the data in JSON format.

POST: /:store - Creates a new document in the specified store.

PUT: /:store/:id - Updates the entire document identified by the provided ID in the specified store.

DELETE: /:store/:id - Deletes a single document from the specified store based on the provided ID.
