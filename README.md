## Error Handling

In cases where the client's request does not fit into the above categories, the API responds with a JSON object containing only one property named "error" and an appropriate error message.

Example error response:
```
{
  "error": "error message"
}
```
Otherwise, the API responds with a message in JSON format.
```
{
  "message": "message"
}
```
